SRS
What we did well:
Time management and allocation
Proactivity in meeting with stakeholders and elliciting requirements
Possible improvements:
Were some situations where we were not sure about the scope of the documentation. Need to actively gains clarity on this early on in the future.

Development
What we did well:
System development was planned well and done very thoroughly.
Prototype often goes above what was required.
Possible improvements:
Ticket creation for the development of some sections could have been done earlier.

Documentation
What we did well:
Ticket creation was done well and each member knew what was required.
Research was done well in sections where we weren't sure what to do.
Time management
Possible improvements:
Not all members were sure of engineering conventions. However, this will be automatically rectified in the future after this project.
