\section{User Stories}
This section describes the system features from a user perspective. These user stories drive the development as their completion verifies that system requirements have been met from the user perspective. The user stories describe the feature a user wants and why they want it. Each user stories are assigned an ID for tracking and sprint planning purposes. Features that are used by multiple users have been assigned a single ID with each reason being described separately by each user. Additionally, each user story is assigned a number of story points. These points describe the overall effort required to understand, research and implement the user story feature.

\subsection{User Story Points}
This section describes the story points for each user story. Story points are a relative measure of overall effort required to implement the user story feature. A baseline user story is selected as a reference with assigned score of 1. Other features are assigned a score relative to the amount of work required for the base feature i.e twice as much work will yield a score of 2.

	\begin{tabular}{@{}|l||l|@{}}

\section{Backlog}
This section is a list of all tasks to be completed for the completion of the project. This includes tasks that move towards completing a user story as well as tasks involving project management, research and documentation. The non-user-story tasks will be given an effort score where one point is the equivalent effort for a story point. This approach was chosen so as to reflect the efforts of non-development team members.
